# problem 1: Basic Transformations
#Create a list of squares for numbers 1-10 using list comprehension.

square = [sq**2 for sq in range(1,11)]
print(square)

#Problem 2: Filtering with Conditions
#Create a list of even numbers from 0-20 that are also divisible by 4.

numbers= []

for i in range(21):
    numbers.append(i)

CondEven = [even for even in numbers if even>0 and even%4 == 0]

print(CondEven)

#Problem 3: Nested Structure Flattening
#Flatten this 2D matrix using list comprehension: [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] Expected output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

NestedList = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

FlattenList = [digit for row in NestedList for digit in row]
print(FlattenList)

#Problem 4: Dictionary Comprehension
#Create a dictionary where keys are numbers 1-5 and values are their cubes.

dict = {num: num**3 for num in range(1,6)}

print(dict)


#Problem 5: Complex Filtering
#Given words = ["python", "is", "awesome", "and", "powerful"] , create a list of tuples containing (word, length)

words = ["python", "is", "awesome", "and", "powerful"]

list = [(w, len(w)) for w in words]
print(list)

#Problem 6: Conditional Expression
#Create a list comprehension that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, but only for
#temperatures above 0Â°C. Input: celsius_temps = [-10, 0, 15, 25, 30, -5]

celsius_temps = [-10, 0, 15, 25, 30, -5]

farenheits_temp = [temp * (9/5) + 32 for temp in celsius_temps if temp > 0]
print(farenheits_temp)

#Problem 7: Set Comprehension Challenge
#From a string "hello world programming", create a set of unique consonants (non-vowel letters).
